# Web Server

In this section, I have documented the step-by-step process I followed to configure my Ubuntu web server from a fresh install. I have gathered solutions from various platforms, aiming to consolidate them into a single, easily accessible resource. My goal is to simplify the configuration process not only for myself but also for others who may find it beneficial. I hope you find this compilation helpful in your server setup endeavors.
